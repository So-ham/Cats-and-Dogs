### Simple CNN Architecture to Classify Cats and Dogs
Here in this notebook we use CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) to classify cats and dogs using the infamous **cats and dogs dataset**.
You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)<br>
We are going to use **Keras** which is an open source neural-network library and running on top of Tensorflow (in this case).
